- all software used here should have install script in runs...
- brew should also handle large part of it, if possible ofc.
- for now i am fine that brew is here and handles 'single-OS' setup, but what if I want to get into linux too?
- prune the Brewfile? Probably I dont need lot of stuff there anyway?
